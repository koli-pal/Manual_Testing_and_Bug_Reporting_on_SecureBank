## Manual Testing
Manual testing is the process of manually executing test cases without using any automated tools to identify bugs, defects, or issues in a software application. It is performed by testers to ensure that the software behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements.

## Application Name
SecureBank

## Software Used
- [Xmind](https://www.xmind.net/): For Mindmap Design.
- [Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/): For writing test cases and other contents.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): For testing and finding bugs. You can use any other web application.
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): For runing the application.

- **Usability Testing:** Evaluates user-friendliness and accessibility.  
- **UI Testing:** Validates input field boundaries.  
- **Browser Compatibility Testing:** Confirms performance across multiple browsers.  

## Test Plan
Test planning was conducted for better understanding of the project and to overview the entire application. Writing a test plan for manual testing is crucial for organizing and standardizing the testing process. It ensures that testing is thorough, consistent, and aligned with the projectâ€™s objectives.  

## Mind Map
Creating a mind map for manual testing provides a visual and intuitive way to organize and communicate the testing process. It helps testers break down complex ideas, prioritize tasks, and ensure comprehensive coverage of testing scenarios.  

## Test Scenarios
Writing test scenarios for manual testing is an essential step in the quality assurance process. Test scenarios help ensure that all possible actions and workflows within the application are tested effectively.

## Test Case Writing
This is the main part of the project. After setting up test planning and scenarios, test cases were written and executed systematically. All the test cases have been executed without delay.  
- **Total Test Cases:** 48  
- **Passed:** 39  
- **Failed:** 9  

## Test Summary
A test summary for manual testing is an essential part of the testing lifecycle. It provides a comprehensive overview of the testing process, outcomes, and overall product quality.

## Bug Report
Bug reporting is a critical activity in manual testing, as it provides a structured way to document and communicate issues discovered during the testing process. The number of bugs discovered in test case execution is concentrated in this section. As noted from the previous section (Test Case Writing), 9 test cases failed. 
- **Issues Identified:** SL-7, 11, 12, 19, 23, 27, 28, 33, 40.   
 

## Test Metrics
Test metrics for manual testing is essential for measuring, analyzing, and improving the testing process and the overall quality of the product. Test metrics provide quantifiable data to track the progress, efficiency, and effectiveness of testing activities.  
- **Execution Rate:** 100%  
- **Pass Rate:** 81.25%  
- **Fail Rate:** 19%
